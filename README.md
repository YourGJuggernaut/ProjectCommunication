# ProjectCommunication
A Python Communication project 

I am still a begineer in programing, so this is one of my bigger projects

For yall idiots who dont understand coding let me explain


This is a simple project
About communication;

this is just a beginging

for now it is just a binary-string converter
(DataDE is In and Out, DataEN is Encode)* - Possible change to DataIN, DataEN, DataOUT

numbin.py has 2 functions for now

1. numtobin() - Converts a Number to binary
2. bintonum() - Converts a binary to Number

binEnc.py - Gets the letter and converts it to binary, then saves it to dataEN 
then it does that for the next letter

binDec.py - Gets the 6-bit chunk and converts it to letter, then saves it to dataDE
then it does taht for the next chunk

The Alphabet System:
1. Convert 5 bit binary to number
2. Add 96
3. Convert to ASCII
Example:
00001 = 1 + 97 = ASCII(98) = b

What is left to do:

detection of \n [ DONE ]

detection of SPACE [ DONE ]

Addition of symbols;

Addition of Uppercase;

Addition of Numbers;
