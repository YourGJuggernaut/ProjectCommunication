# ProjectCommunication

ProjectCommunication
A Python Communication Project

I am still a beginner in programming, so this is one of my bigger projects.

For those who might not be familiar with coding, let me explain:

This is a simple project focused on communication. It's just the beginning, but here's what it does for now:

### About the Project
This project is currently a binary-string converter:
- **DataDE**: Input and output for decoded data
- **DataEN**: Encoded data
- *(Potentially changing to DataIN, DataEN, DataOUT)*
- **Any Code, For my sake of learning, Generated by ChatGPT is highlighted**
### Key Components
#### `numbin.py`
This module contains two primary functions:
1. **`numtobin()`**: Converts a number to binary.
2. **`bintonum()`**: Converts binary to a number.

#### `binEnc.py`
This script takes letters, converts them to binary, and saves them to `DataEN`. It processes each letter sequentially.

#### `binDec.py`
This script takes 6-bit binary chunks, converts them to letters, and saves them to `DataDE`. It processes each chunk sequentially.

### The Alphabet System
1. Convert a 5-bit binary to a number.
2. Add 96 to the number.
3. Convert the result to an ASCII character.

**Example:**
- `00001` = 1 + 97 = ASCII(98) = 'b'


# Features
- **Detection of newline characters (`\n`)**: **DONE**
- **Detection of spaces**: **DONE**
- **Addition of symbols**: *In Progress*
- **Addition of uppercase letters**: **DONE**
- **Addition of numbers**: *In Progress*
