# ProjectCommunication

ProjectCommunication
A Python Communication Project

I am still a beginner in programming, so this is one of my bigger projects.

For those who might not be familiar with coding, let me explain:

This is a simple project focused on communication. It's just the beginning, but here's what it does for now:

### About the Project
This project is currently a binary-string converter:
- **DataIN**: Input for about to be decoded data
- **DataEN**: Encoded data
- **DataOUT**: Output for decoded data
- **Any Code, For my sake of learning, Generated by ChatGPT is highlighted**
### Key Components
#### `numbin.py`
This module contains two primary functions:
1. **`numtobin()`**: Converts a number to binary.
2. **`bintonum()`**: Converts binary to a number.
3. **NEW** **`getkey()`**: Returns True if the first len(key.key) letters of dataEN.pycomm are equal to key.key  
4. **NEW** **`wipekey()`**: Deletes the Key from DataEN.pycomm
#### `binEnc.py`
This script takes letters from `DataIN`, converts them to binary, and saves them to `DataEN`. It processes each letter sequentially.

#### `binDec.py`
This script takes 6-bit binary chunks, converts them to letters, and saves them to `DataOUT`. It processes each chunk sequentially.

### The Alphabet System
1. Convert a 5-bit binary to a number.
2. Add 96 to the number.
3. Convert the result to an ASCII character.

**Example:**
- `00001` = 1 + 97 = ASCII(98) = 'b'


# Output
- **If you want to send somebody This encrypted mess you must send the following:**
1. DataEN.pycomm (The Actuall File)
2. dual.key (The cryptography key)
3. key.key (The Password)
4. metadata.key (Attributes)
- **This will the basic principle of how my Communication will work**
# Features
- **Detection of newline characters (`\n`)**: **DONE**
- **Detection of spaces**: **DONE**
- **Addition of symbols**: *In Progress*
- **Addition of uppercase letters**: **DONE**
- **Addition of numbers**: *In Progress*
- **Encryption of keys**: **DONE**
- **One-time Key + All-time Key**: **DONE**

# **NEW** Security
- When Encoding, You enter a key. A file named key.key gets saved with that key. When it gets encrypted it also puts the key in the dataEN.pycomm
- When Decoding, You enter a key. Checks for if key.key == dataEN.pycomm (key) == user input. If all correct it runs it 2 times (To be trouble shooted) and Deletes the key.key
- Key is now Encrypted using Fernet
- 2 Keys now
