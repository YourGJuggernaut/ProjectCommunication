For yall idiots who dont understand coding let me explain


This is a simple project
About communication;
this is just a beginging
for now it is just a binary-string converter
(DataDE is In and Out, DataEN is Encode)
numbin.py has 2 functions for now
numtobin() - Converts a Number to binary
bintonum() - Converts a binary to Number
binEnc.py - Gets the letter and converts it to binary, then saves it to dataEN 
then it does that for the next letter
binDec.py - Gets the 6-bit chunk and converts it to letter, then saves it to dataDE
then it does taht for the next chunk

What is left to do:
detection of \n [ DONE ]
Addition of symbols
